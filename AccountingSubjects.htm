                   offering a well-structured and in-depth learning path in financial accounting.
                   Designed to build both theoretical knowledge and practical skills, the programme
                   begins with foundational topics such as Bookkeeping to Trial Balance, Payroll,
                   and Monthly SARS Returns, then advances to more complex subjects like Financial Statements,
                   Cost and Management Accounting, and Income Tax Returns.
                   To achieve the National Diploma in Financial Accounting at NQF Level 6,
                   learners must earn 280 credits. By this stage, they will have developed
                   expertise not only in core accounting principles but also in areas such as
                   financial management, corporate strategy, and research methods.
                   The programme places a strong focus on ethical practices, financial reporting,
                   and compliance with regulatory standards—key competencies for a professional career
                   in accounting.The learning journey is designed to be progressive, with each level building
                   on the last to ensure a comprehensive understanding of the subject. The course timeline typically
                   spans 12 months for the introductory level, 6 months each for the intermediate levels, and another
                   12 months for the final phase, providing a complete and balanced education in financial accounting.
                   Entry into the programme requires a minimum of Grade 10 (Standard 8) or an equivalent qualification for the entry-level courses. Progression through the programme depends on the successful completion of earlier modules, ensuring that learners are well-prepared at each stage.
                   Ultimately, this qualification equips students with a blend of practical skills and academic knowledge, preparing them for a successful career in financial accounting and management.</p>
