                <h1>Investment Options</h1>
                <div class="option-box">
                <h2>Buy A house</h2>
                <img src="images/houseBuy.webp" class="investOPT">
                <p>Real estate investment offers a host of advantages, such as generating passive income, 
                    ensuring consistent cash flow, providing tax breaks, 
                    diversifying your portfolio, and allowing you to leverage financing.
                    When you secure a tenant, lenders often count that rental income toward your earnings,
                    making it easier over time to expand your property holdings and qualify for lower down payments
                    on additional purchases. As property values generally rise, the amount you initially invest 
                    can significantly increase—potentially even doubling by the time you sell. Rising market
                    values also justify raising rents each year. In essence, property investors earn 
                    returns from rent payments, 
                    long-term appreciation, and any business ventures tied to their real estate.</p>

                <h2>Rent A house</h2>
                 <img src="images/rent.jpg" class="investOPT">
                 <p>Renting offers greater flexibility compared to owning a home, whether it’s a house or an apartment. 
                    You aren’t committed to the property indefinitely, and you’re typically not responsible for setting aside 
                    funds for repairs, 
                    covering property taxes or insurance, or managing other maintenance costs.</p>
                 </div>
                 <div class="option-box">
                 <h2>Buy Land</h2>
                  <img src="images/land.jpeg" class="investOPT">
                  <p>While you can depreciate structures, land itself isn’t eligible for depreciation.
                     Investing in land can yield substantial returns, generate passive income, and deliver significant 
                     profit margins—often without a huge upfront cost if you’re familiar with land financing. 
                     Still, like any investment, profitable land acquisition demands thorough research and due diligence. As a finite, 
                    physical asset, land tends to be more affordable to purchase and offers unique long-term value.</p>
